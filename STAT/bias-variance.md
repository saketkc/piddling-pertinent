The Bias Variance tradeoff

You have an assignment to complete with just one 
question remaining. The calculations are just too tedious
and you are bored enough. The TA does not grade all questions
and hence there is a 1% chance it gets considered. Incase it does,
you stand to lose 10 points. But the effort it takes to complete
this problem is 20 units.

Case 1  You decide to take 20 points worth of effort. The variance 
in this case is 0. Whether or not the TA corrects the question
you are safe. However the bias might be very high.(the TA might choose 
not to correct and hence the modelsâ€™ predicted value is fare less than the correct
vakue)

Case 2 Your laziness takes over and you give up.(Happens with me all the time)
The variance in this case is quite high. However the bias is inexistent.
